# Events - telegram bot for message scheduling

https://t.me/tg_event_scheduler_bot

Telegram bot for scheduling events (written in Rust of course).

## Quirks

Currently the date and time that you enter for scheduling is locked at GMT+3 timezone as telegram doesn't make it easy to work with local user timezones.
